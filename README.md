#_README for Pizza Order_#
###Created by Noah Kittleson###

##**Description**##
This is a basic web app that uses javascript objects to simulate a pizza ordering site.

##**How It Works**##

Pizzas are stored as objects with an array of toppings and a size (in inches).  Pizza has two methods: getPrice() and getName().  The getPrice method starts with a base price based on the area of the pizza, then adds more for toppings.  The getName method just returns a string that describes the pizza, for example: "16' pizza with pepperoni".  You can enter multiple pizzas and it keeps track of the running total for all pizzas.

##**Setup**##
